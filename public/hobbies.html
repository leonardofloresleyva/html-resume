            <p>
                By far my favorite hobbie of all. I've been gaming since I was a kid, <br/>
                and I think I'm going to continue to do so until the rest of my days <br/>
                (maybe I'll get to develop one?). Here's my all time favorites:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>GTA San Andreas.</li>
                <li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>
                <li>Halo 3</li>
                <li>Resident Evil 2 (Remake)</li>
                <li>Silent Hill 2</li>
                <li>GTA 5</li>
                <li>Resident Evil 4 (Original and Remake)</li>
                <li>The Last Of Us</li>
                <li>Uncharted 4</li>
                <li>Fallout 2</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

        <!--Soccer/Football section-->
        <li>
            <h2>Soccer/Football &#9917:</h2>
            <p>
                My favorite sport without doubts (probably the only one I actually have interest in).<br/>
                I've always ejoyed it, for both playing it (although I barely play these days &#128532) and <br/>
                watching it. My favorite team is and always has been Barcelona, and my favorite <br/>
                player is Lionel Messi (always has been too haha).
            </p>
        </li>

        <!--Reading section-->
        <li>
            <h2>Reading &#128366:</h2>
            <p>
                This is probably my most recent hobby of the list, since I haven't an active reader in<br/>
                the past. Today, I'm starting to get why school and teachers always encouraged us to <br/>
                read books and make reading a habit. So far, my favorite book is Neuromancer, by<br/>
                William Gibson (I'm a big Cyberpunk fan).
            </p>
        </li>

        <!--Music-->
        <li>
            <h2>Music &#127900:</h2>
            <p>
                It's almost like listening to music today has become an essential part of human life,<br/>
                almost as eating and breathing, and I'm not here to defraud my species. Here's my<br/>
                favorite songs:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Bailando Solo - Los Bunkers</li>
                <li>Call It What You Want - Foster The People</li>
                <li>Lose Yourself - Eminem</li>
                <li>Supermassive Black Hole - Muse</li>
                <lI>Enter Sandman - Metallica</lI>
            </ul>
            <p>Maybe one day I get to play an instrument.</p>
        </li>

        <!--Movies and TV Series section-->
        <li>
            <h2>Movies and TV Series &#127909:</h2>
            <p>
                Who doesn't watch Movies and TV Series today? So do I. Although, I included <br/>
                both types because, well, they're very similar, and so don't making this list <br/>
                much longer. These are my favorite movies and TV serieses:
